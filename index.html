<h1> The Best Movies According to Gyeduaa </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time </h2>
<hr/>
<h3> Titanic </h3>

<p>This movie is amazing!  I love watching it! Jack and Rose, even though they are not real people and never were, feel so realistic and the effects and clothing and decoration they used in this movie makes it feel like I’m actually on the titanic with them! The flooding and sinking scenes were AMAZING and for a 1997 movie, I thought I was watching something from the future. This movie is a must-watch, and there is no wonder why it won so many awards, because it is most definitely the best movie this world has ever known. I also cannot think of anyone else to play Jack and Rose than Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They both did an absolutely awesome job and fit in very well with their roles, and the directors picked their entire cast very wisely. The “My heart Will go on” song was the perfect fit for the movie, and got stuck in my head after the 80th time I watched it, which is a very low estimate of the number of times I binge-watched this movie from my sofa with a bucket of popcorn. There are some bits of the movie which are not historically accurate, but oh so few of them, that it doesn’t really even matter.
    In other words, this movie is something you must watch at least once before the day you die, you will NOT regret it. </p>
    
    <h3>The Great Ghatsby </h3>
    <p>  was very impressed by this film. Even though it was no very popular among critics, this was far better than I assumed and hoped. Leonardo Di Caprio did an amazing job as Gatsby, you could feel and understand his pain. I would also like to give credit to Tobey Maguire he was a great role for Nick since he was amazing at describing the scene and made me feel bad for Gatsby at the end. Also Tobey even though usually calm in manner in his roles, does great is his occasional fits of rage. I liked how they teamed up Leo and Tobey as they are childhood friends. The songs and cinematography were perfect, and sometimes it all felt very eerie and fit the mood of the story perfectly. </p>

    <h3> Shriek </h3>
    <p> A classic in both the world of animation and in computer animation. This is arguably the sleeper film that showed that a studio outside of Disney could do a great fully computer animated film.All the main characters are memorable, the way they used familiar fairy tale characters is funny and clever/unique, the story goes completely against what you'd expect (which is what they're going for), and the soundtrack perfectly fits the mood or is used for quick punches of fun.
